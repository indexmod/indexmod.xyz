Interview with Andrey Deichenko, creator of Indexmod Chainpædia

1. **Science Nature and Blond:** Andrey, tell us about the conceptual update of Indexmod Chainpædia. What are these changes and how do they impact your project?

   **Andrey Deichenko (Indexmod Chainpædia):** I conceived Indexmod while working in the fashion department at GQ magazine — I had to browse through many new designers and brands for work, and I thought they could be classified in a new, three-dimensional way. I came up with a concept where each article in the encyclopedia would be transformed into an index using an algorithm, which would then be visualized three-dimensionally in color, representing the entire world of fashion in a new, unusual three-dimensional graph-aquarium, where each encyclopedia topic was a living energy clot floating in three-dimensional space.

2. **Science Nature and Blond:** What were the main goals for you when launching this update after 18 years? What challenges did you encounter during its development?

   **Andrey Deichenko (Indexmod Chainpædia):** The main challenge of our time is the lack of time — while you're brainstorming something sitting at your kitchen table, it soon appears in several points around the world. This speaks to the approaching technological singularity.

3. **Science Nature and Blond:** What key innovations and opportunities does this update bring to Indexmod Chainpædia users?

   **Andrey Deichenko (Indexmod Chainpædia):** The thing is, Indexmod Chainpædia still doesn't have users. Once upon a time, I thought everything would work like a wiki — that is, articles would appear through user contributions. With the new concept, everything could change — the user would only need to outline the topic of a future article, and the article would start living its own life, being supplemented, edited, and improved in real-time. For example, the first article in the updated Indexmod Chainpædia about Yuri Vafin, the thing is, this character is most likely a pseudonym for a young talented author. By creating an article in Indexmod Chainpædia, I activate an algorithm that will search for all mentions of Yuri Vafin, check and record sources, and edit and improve the article text.

4. **Science Nature and Blond:** How do you envision your audience's reaction to these changes? Are there any feedback or responses you are proud of?

   **Andrey Deichenko (Indexmod Chainpædia):** This concept can turn into a personal encyclopedia of knowledge, which will constantly update the articles you create in the background. Imagine it as a personal secretary whom you assign to monitor a certain phenomenon, and the results are formed into an article, the text of which is updated as new facts are found and rechecked.

5. **Science Nature and Blond:** What prospects do you see for the further development of Indexmod Chainpædia after this update? Are there any specific plans for the future?

   **Andrey Deichenko (Indexmod Chainpædia):** I have now redesigned the interface of Indexmod Chainpædia, making it extremely concise, and started studying the APIs of language models in order to create an application that will work "under the hood" of the updated Indexmod Chainpædia.

6. **Science Nature and Blond:** How do you think your project can contribute to the development of modern technologies and digital culture as a whole?

   **Andrey Deichenko (Indexmod Chainpædia):** Our own intellect is now greatly amplified with the use of AI, and now is a wonderful time to test any concepts that previously required the efforts and work of a team of specialists.

7. **Science Nature and Blond:** Finally, what advice or thoughts would you like to share with our readers, especially those who may be interested in your project and its update?

   **Andrey Deichenko (Indexmod Chainpædia):** Imagine, now in order to read a reference about something, you need to conduct research, google it, consult Wikipedia. Now imagine that you create a topic about an interesting question or object, and the article about it starts to form itself, updating and improving daily, neatly preserving and rechecking all the sources used.
